# 30 Days of Web Redesign

## Project Description

This repository contains my personal challenge of redesigning 30 websites in 30 days. Starting from a base template, I've been building new branches and customizing each of the 30 web redesigns.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to practice and improve my web development skills, focusing on the use of different components and design techniques. Each day, I faced the challenge of redesigning a different webpage, working against the clock to complete the daily project.

## Repository Structure

- The main branch (`main`) contains the base template.
- Each redesign has its own branch, named according to the day and project (e.g., `day-1-landing-page`, `day-2-blog`, etc.).
