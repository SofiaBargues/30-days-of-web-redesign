        As new custodians of the micro pub we hope to continue in the footsteps
        of Karen and Jim and stay true to the venues friendly and warm
        atmosphere while adding a bit of our own personalities along the way.
        Housed in what was originally the barn for convalescing dogs from the
        vets The Dog House is a warm and inviting micro pub offering local ales,
        homemade food and live music. We also have an extensive vinyl collection
        for you to peruse and play or bring your own along and listen while you
        relax with a drink.
