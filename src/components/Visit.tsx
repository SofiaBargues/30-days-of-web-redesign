        Charity: The Fishing Quarter is an historic place of interest on
        Brighton Seafront. A family friendly place of calm that visitors can
        enjoy in the hustle and bustle of a very busy seafront. A place which
        celebrates the ancient to current history of this special seafront. In
        addition, a community based, non-commercialised space, in which artists
        and makers can showcase their passions and work.
